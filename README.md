These are code examples I use during presentations.

Typically, I first demonstrate the use of the Groovy shell to test out Geb snippets live.

To use the Groovy shell with the interactive Geb script, execute ```groovysh``` from the directory where you cloned this repository, then execute ```load interactive.groovy``` from the groovy shell.

Also, this repository contains different branches that correspond to different parts of the presentation where I am trying to demostrate different features of Geb. "master" represents the code at the end of the presentation.

Below is the order the branches progress through:
* initialTest
* moduleTest
* functionTest

Slides from the DFW Groovy/Grails Presentation can be found here: http://www.slideshare.net/jhamit/geb-save-time-with-groovy-functional-testing

Suggestions and feedback are appreciated.
